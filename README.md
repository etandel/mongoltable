1) About
---
Inspired by MongoDict, MongoLtable is a library that allows persistence of Lua tables with mongodb.

It works by doing some simple metatable magic, so all key-value pairs are actually stored on a mongodb collection.
It is still under development, so check "dev" or "feature/*" branches for the latest.

2) Author and License
---
MingoLtable was created by Elias Tandel Barrionovo <elias 'dot' tandel 'at' gmail 'dot' com>.
Its license is MIT, same as Lua itself. Checkout "LICENSE.TXT" for more details.
